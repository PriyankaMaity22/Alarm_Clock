# Alarm_Clock
The "Alarm Clock" project is a Python program that allows users to set an alarm time using a graphical user interface created with the Tkinter library. The program uses the current time to check if the alarm time has been reached and plays an alarm sound using the Pygame library

This project is a simple alarm clock built using Python's Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface and Pygame for playing an alarm sound. It allows the user to set an alarm time in hours, minutes, and seconds, and the alarm will sound when that time is reached.
